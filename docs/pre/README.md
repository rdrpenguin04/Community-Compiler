# The Dusk Programming Language

## Pre-Bootstrap

This folder will detail the spec of the pre-bootstrap compiler. The
pre-bootstrap spec will be determined by taking the finished post-bootstrap spec
and removing features that are unnecessary for the building of the compiler.

Therefore, until the post-bootstrap docs are written, no documentation should
be written here.
